- E1.5 a) $(\sqrt{x})^2 = 4^2$, I get it. But why is this other approach wrong?
$$\sqrt x = 4$$
multiply both sides by $\sqrt x$
$$\sqrt x \cdot \sqrt x = 4 \cdot \sqrt x$$
doesn't look good (and also losing solutions, right?)
$$x = 4\sqrt x$$
- E1.5 b) how is $g^-1(x)=-\frac{1}{2} \ln x$? (have to review inverse functions way better)

Page 25:
- while the commutative and associative properties seem to tell me something fundamental about the operation, I can't understand how the distributive one is placed in the same class. Isn't it just telling me that I can collapse/expand parenthesis? Is it only for notation or has it some deeper meaning I'm not seeing?

Page 33:
- if $\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$ I was inclined to think that $-\frac{1}{\phi} = - \phi^{-1} = -\frac{2}{1+\sqrt{5}}$ but it's instead $\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}$, poxa!

Page 34:
- he says quadratic factoring is $f(x) = ax^2+bx+c = a(x-x_1)(x-x_2)$ but since the $a$ is in the quadratic formula, the last one should read $1(x-x_1)(x-x_2)$, no?
- how should it be "evident" that I can rewrite any quadratic (with real coefficients?) as $a(x-x_1)(x-x_2)$? From the (uncited) fundamental theorem of algebra?

Page 38:
- just to be clear: the $=$ operator is overloaded here, right? $R(n) = 25n$ is an assignment, while $R(n)=7000$ is an equation (asking the inverse evaluation of a function?)
